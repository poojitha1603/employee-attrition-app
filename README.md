# Employee Attrition Prediction App

This is a **Machine Learning project** that predicts whether an employee is likely to **resign** or **stay** in a company based on features like Age, Monthly Income, Job Satisfaction, OverTime, and more.  

The app is built using **Python**, **scikit-learn**, and **Gradio** for a simple web interface.
